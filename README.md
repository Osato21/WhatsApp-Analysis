# WhatsApp-Analysis

# Introduction
An assignment on cleaning and analysing a WhatsApp group chat data and dashboard creation in PowerBI. The documentation includes;
- Data Gathering & Transformation
- Data & Report Limitation
#Data Gathering
To get the WhatsApp chat data, I simply exported the chat from the WhatsApp group by clicking to the three dots at the top right corner of the group chat and selecting "Export Chat". That exported the chat as a text file. It was cleaned using PowerBi. Afterwards, a dashboard was created to show findings.
# Data and report Limitation
The exported data shows only messages from Febraury 2023.
